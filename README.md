Hello! Iâ€™m a Computer Engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. My interests are in self driving cars, high performance C/C++, and embedded software development. I focus on low-level systems programming in C/C++ and Python for implementing machine learning models, testing, and scripting.
When not working, I enjoy playing soccer, making and listening to music, lifting, running, and cooking.
